# Challenge01 
Horiseon

## Description
The challenge was to code refactor of HTML, CSS, and Git, we were given an already workable code as an on-the-job ticket that we had to modify by refactoring (improving without changing its execution) while also leaving the code a little bit cleaner. In cleaning up code and making it more accessible to people the code can be followed more easily as well as imoroved on for future projects.

## Code
The code is a source code from the client and it is located in the Challenge repository, along with the CSS, Index.html, READ.ME.

## Work
The first item we did was to change all the div/span into more aemantic titles, wherever a header was needed we put and thus wherever a section was needed we also put, in doing so we also needed to change the CSS code in order for the correct selectors to be represented for example there was a div in CSS but when we changed to a semantic style such as section we then had to change the corrisponding CSS code as to match the HTML code selectors. The next thing was to improve on the code by giving certain classes to certain sections as to not need redundant code, for example their did not need to be a .benefits-class/.benefits-lead/.benefits-cost class that all had the same code, so instead it was decided to make the code less redundant and more friendly by making those three into one class of .benefits-box which cut down on code, improves the site, made the code cleaner, as well as still kept the funtionality of the original code.
